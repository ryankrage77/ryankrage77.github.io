      <h1 id="header">26th January 2017<br>My First Blog Post</h1>
      <div id="body">
      <p>This is my first post on this new blog. I've had blogs before, and largely filled them with very boring material, and they were more of a diary I felt comfortable with sharing.</p>
      <p>I've been doing a lot of coding today for a college project, which involved getting a Raspberry Pi to recognise faces, automatically take a picture, encode it, send it to a database, and then make the back-end database stuff display the image on a webpage.<br />I managed to get everything except that last part working, but by that point I was too fed up to care.</p>
      <p>Enough about my boring life. I've spent that last few weeks getting this site up and running, and now I'm finally happy with the design and underlying structure, I should be able to easily add new content - such as blog posts and story chapters.</p>
      <p>I intend to primarily post fiction and blog posts, and occasionally programs I've written (hence the code section). I prefer creating my site from scratch because it's just more satisfying to maintain all the low-level stuff myself, and having complete control over everything, down to the last pixel, really appeases my 'OCD' (I don't actually have OCD, it's just the quickest way to describe my insistence for perfection in that which I create. I rarely acheive it, but that's another story).</p>
      <p>Over the next few weeks, I'll be moving all the content from my old site onto this one. I'll probably leave the old one up, just in case I want to use it for something else, or even switch back.</p>
      <p>Enough procastinating, I'm going to add more fiction content.</p>
