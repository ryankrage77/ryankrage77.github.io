        <p>Intent.</p><p>It's a loaded word, no? The declaration of an attempt to achieve something. Not quite a promise, oath, pact or deal; just a statement that says 'I will try'.</p><p>I intend to do many things. I have two novels planned, one started. I <em>intend</em> to finish them. That's no garuantee I will, but I want to try. I <em>intend</em> to update this blog a minimum of once very four days (on average). So far, I am achieving this.</p><p>However, intent is a procastinators best friend. It enables us to reassure ourselves that we've made an effort before we've done anything. We've said we'll have a go, and that's what counts.</p><p>Except it isn't. Words without action are words.</p><p>'But,' you say, 'words can change the world! The pen is mightier than the sword.'</p><p>Wrong. Words can inspire action, and that is what makes them powerful. The word 'intent' carries more meaning than 'try' or 'attempt', it sounds more certain, and therefore is better at inspiring action, and thus a more powerful word.</p><p>The other side of this coin is that we trick ourselves into mistaking the impact of our words for the impact of our actions. I can say I intend to do something, and because I have declared my intent I can justify procastination because I've done 'something', and then I can justify my failiure because I never promised, I only said I wanted to try.</p><p>I like to take words at face value. I do not make promises lightly, but I do not break them either. I often say 'I'll do my best' or 'I will try' and then fail to do so, but I do not say 'I promise I will' unless I am certain of my ability and motivation to complete the task in question. My promises are iron-clad, as close to physical intent as I can speak.</p><p>In this sense, the pen is mightier than the sword. If the resolve behind your words is solid, then the words themselves carry the weight of your actions before you do anything.</p><p>What's my point? Words are powerful, and as we all know, with great power comes great responsibility. Words can inspire action, and action changes, heals or damages. Words can save lives or destroy them.</p><p>Use your words for good, and use them carefully.</p>
