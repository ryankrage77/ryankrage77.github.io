      <p>So, in my last update I said I was trying to update this blog once every four days... yeah, that didn't happen.<br>Still, one slip-up is no reason to give up.</p>
      <p>I feel like listing some stuff that's happened to me recently, and as this is <em>my</em> blog, I will. here goes:</p>
      <p>- I've done no writing.<br>- I have done no folding.<br>- I have started using linux.<br>- I tried to get into bitcoin mining, but gave up immediatley, not because it isn't profitable but because <em>none of the software works out of the box!</em> Developers, fix yo stuff.<br>- I had another idea for a story. I'm still struggling to decide whether to let it stand alone or fold it into <em>In The End</em>/<em>Orimin</em>.<br>- I've discovered some really great music. I'll include some links to spotify playlists at the bottom.</p>
      <p>So basically thanks to my lack of work ethic, the last eight days (only eight days? Wow. Time flies when you're having fun.) have been incredibly unproductive and somewhat boring.</p>
      <p>For a blog that's supposed to be mildly thought-provoking, I talk an awful lot about myself. I think I'll start keeping a diary instead of using this as one.</p>
      <p>OK, now for some stuff that pertains to you, dear reader.<br>- I'm trying to get more organised and develop some good habits, and I have free time coming up, so expect regular-ish updates to fiction and code content.<br>- I have plans to add some extra features to this site, such as comments. I'll probably need some JavaScript and PHP, so it could take a while. Fear not, I have a less elegant solution in mind too. I'll go into more detail on the code page.</p>
