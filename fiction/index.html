      <p>This is an up-to-date list of all fiction <em>currently on the site</em>. I've written more than is here, but uploading stuff is boring.</p>
      <p><a href="years">For Hundreds and Hundreds of Years</a><br>A short story about immortality, 'inspired' (read: copied) from the end of "It's A Beautiful Day". I consider this the worst thing I've ever written (barring some stuff that will never see the light of day), as it was written in about an hour while I was feeling ill.</p>
      <p><a href="scp">SCP 3001</a><br>My attempt at creating an SCP.</p>
      <p><a href="/fiction/hybrid">Hybrid</a><br>A story about an escaped experiment and the student who finds her. Inspired by <em>Maximum Ride</em> and <em>Alien</em>.</p>
