      <h1 id="header">SCP 3001</h1>
      <div id="body">
<p><em>This was inspired by the <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/" target="_blank">SCP Foundation</a>, a wiki of fictional supernatural/abnormal items. The SCP's are user-created, and everything is documented as though it's real.</em></p>

<p><em>I came up with an idea for one, but it's too short and not original enough to warrant being on the SCP site, so I'm putting it here instead.</em></p>

<p><b>SCP-3001</b></p>

<p>Class: Euclid</p>

<p>Containment procedure:<br />
SCP-3001 is supposedly in a standard containment locker in area 17. However, any attempt to certify this is unnecessary. Current containment procedures for the area are sufficient.</p>

<p>Description:<br />
SCP-3001 convinces anyone aware of its existence that it should not be observed, in person, by visual recording or even through description.<br />
People can be made aware of its existence via any method of communicating information, so long as the recipient can understand it.<br />
Description of SCP-3001’s anomalous properties is possible, although it takes considerable willpower.<br />
No researcher is able to open its locker or convince class D staff to do so, as SCP-3001 should remain unobserved. All known anti-memetic procedures should not be implemented, due to the fact that SCP-3001 must remain unobserved.<br />
If SCP-3001 is actually inside its locker (and has no anomalous temporal or dimensional properties), its size may vary from SCP-3001 should not be measured to SCP-3001 should not be measured.</p>

<p><em>Note: It appears that any attempt to theorize as to SCP-3001’s appearance will result in descriptions similar to the above.</em></p>

<p>SCP-3001 also causes anyone aware of it to dissuade others from attempting to observe it, as can be seen in this report.</p>

<p>Remember, do not attempt to observe SCP-3001, or try to convince others to do so.</p>
