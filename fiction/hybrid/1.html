          BRIRIRIRIRIRIRIRIRIRIRIRIRIRING!<br />
I immediately packed my stuff away and headed for the door. I had my hand on the door handle when -<br />
"And where do you think you're going?" asked my English teacher sternly.<br />
I slowly turned to face her. "Erm... home?"<br />
She sighed. "Off you go then."<br />
Everyone immediately stampeded towards the door. I ran at the front of the crowd, heading for the bus. The English block was the furthest away from the bus stop, and the bus was a public one, not a school bus, that left exactly two minutes after school ended. I had about thirty seconds to get there or I would miss it. Usain Bolt would have been proud.<br />
When I got there, the doors were just closing. Ben, the driver, saw me, and opened them again.<br />
"English?" he asked as I paid.<br />
"Yeah" I said in between heaving breaths, and went to find a seat. I leant against the window and began day-dreaming. I always tried to sit next to a window - I liked to watch the scenery flashing by, and it stopped me missing my stop. The twenty-minute journey ticked away, and eventually I arrived at my stop.<br />
"Thanks," I said to Ben as I got off.<br />
"See you tomorrow," he replied.<br />
The bus was usually empty in the mornings, so I would sit at the front and chat to Ben on the way to school. He had once been in the army, and actually kept a gun on his bus. The bus didn't stop right outside my house. It stopped on the corner of a T-junction at the end of the road I lived on. It was a ten-minute walk down the road.<br />
I was jolted out of another day-dream by the sound of someone crying. In fact they were sobbing. I stopped and looked around to try and locate the sound, but couldn't see anyone. I kept walking, and then realised the sound was coming from a small path between two houses. I walked down the path, and saw the person crying.<br />
It was a teenage girl, maybe fourteen or fifteen years old. She was wearing baggy tracksuit bottoms and a white T-shirt several sizes too large. She was also wearing hiking boots that were too big as well.<br />
She was sitting against a wall, hugging her legs with her head resting on her knees and sobbing her heart out.<br />
I crouched down next to her.<br />
"Hey. Are you OK?" I asked quietly.<br />
She froze and went silent for a few seconds, and then lifted her head to look at me. Her eyes were bright green with flecks of blue.<br />
"Are you OK?" I asked again.<br />
"Yes." She whispered. She seemed scared of me.<br />
"You're clearly not. What's wrong?"<br />
She was silent for a long time, but eventually she spoke.<br />
"I I ran away... from home." She spoke slowly, as if searching for the right words.<br />
I thought for a moment. "Do you want to come to my house for a while? My parents won't be home for a few hours."<br />
She looked around, as though someone was going to overhear us.<br />
"Yes."<br />
"Come on then." I said, and stood up. I held out a hand to help her up.<br />
She ignored it and stood up. She was about half a head shorter than me, and had dark brown hair – very messy, waist-length brown hair. I wondered how long it had been since she had a haircut.<br />
"This way," I said, and began walking. She hesitated, and then followed, walking slightly behind me as though afraid to get to close.<br />
"What's your name?" I asked.<br />
She didn't reply. I turned to look at her. She was still staring at me, so she probably heard the question.<br />
"You don't have to tell me." I said.<br />
I noticed that even when I had slowed down while turning to talk to her, she had slowed down too and stayed behind me. We arrived at my house, and I unlocked the door and we went inside.<br />
I kicked off my shoes and dropped my rucksack and headed for the kitchen. "Are you hungry?" I asked as I grabbed plates and ingredients for a sandwich.<br />
"Yes." She said. It was practically the only thing I had heard her say.<br />
"Well, come over here then." I said. "A Nutella sandwich will make you feel better."<br />
I began making the sandwiches. She walked over, her boots thumping on the floor. My parents would kill me if I did that, but I didn't care.<br />
"The secret to a Nutella sandwich is to have a ratio of one part margarine, three parts Nutella." I said as I sliced the sandwich in half and handed her the plate. She watched me take a bite of my sandwich, and then hesitantly took a bite of hers. As she chewed, her eyes widened, and then she devoured the rest of it in three bites. She barely even chewed.<br />
"Good, yeah?" I asked around a mouthful of sandwich.<br />
She nodded.<br />
I took her plate and dumped it on the pile of other things in the sink, and carried on eating. I wondered what to do when my parents got home.<br />
"Where's the bathroom?" She asked suddenly.<br />
"At the top of the stairs. Just go up and it's straight in front." I replied.<br />
I turned to put my plate in the sink, and by the time I turned around again, she was already halfway up the stairs. I hoped she wasn't allergic to anything in the sandwich. I headed upstairs to my room, to get changed.<br />
Just as I finished changing, I heard a loud crash from the bathroom, and a cry of pain. I quickly threw open my door and knocked on the bathroom door.<br />
"Are you OK? Did you fall over or something?"<br />
No reply.<br />
"Hello? Are you OK?"<br />
Still no answer. I counted to five in my head.<br />
"If you don't answer, I'm going to have to open the door." For all I knew, she had cracked her head on the sink.<br />
"OK, I'm coming in." I said.<br />
I slowly opened the door and looked in.<br />
She was standing side-on to me, and there were soap and shampoo bottles all over the floor. She must have –<br />
Then I noticed her eyes. Her pupils were slits, like a cats. And then I noticed the tail. She had a long, jet black tail sticking out from under her T-shirt. My eyes moved along the length of the tail, which was smooth had small spines dotted along it, until it reached the tip, which was about two feet above her head, and ended in a curved scythe-like blade.<br />
I slammed the door and braced myself against it, breathing hard.<br />
"What the hell!" I yelled. "What was that? What the hell are you?"<br />
She didn't reply.<br />
I slowly sank to the floor, trying to get my breathing under control.<br />
"What are you?" I asked again.<br />
"I... I don't know."<br />
"You don't know?" I echoed. "Why do you have a freaking tail?"<br />
"I was... created. By Oxyribo."<br />
Oxyribo was a medical research company, looking for cures for various diseases, including cancer. Their name came from the middle part of DNA, deoxyribonucleic. So far as I knew, they didn't create messed-up people with weird eyes and tails. They operative word being knew. Past tense.<br />
She tried to open the door, but I held it shut.<br />
"I'm not going to hurt you." She said.<br />
There's a weird mutant human in my bathroom and I don't know what she is, but she says she won't kill me, so I've got that going for me, which is nice, I thought.<br />
"How did they, um, create you?" I asked.<br />
"I don't understand it, but they said that they used the DNA from different animals. I think"<br />
"So, you're like, a human-animal hybrid?"<br />
"That's another word they used. Hybrid."<br />
"Why?"<br />
"I don't understand."<br />
"Why did they create you?"<br />
"To be a weapon. To kill people."<br />
A weapon. Another thing I didn't know Oxyribo made.<br />
"How did you keep it hidden? The tail, and your eyes."<br />
"My eyes can look normal. I kept my tail inside my clothes."<br />
"And why were you crying? Did you run away from... wherever they created you?"<br />
"Yes."<br />
"Was it... did you not like it there?"<br />
"No," she whispered. "I did not like it there." I could hear a wobble in her voice, so I guessed whatever caused her to run away... well, I probably shouldn't ask.<br />
"Can I come out now?" She asked.<br />
"Hang on a sec, I'm trying not to faint."<br />
"What does that mean?" she asked. "Faint." she added, for clarification.<br />
"You don't know what... did you... did anyone ever teach you things?" I asked. The beginnings of a horrible realisation were stirring in my mind.<br />
"No." she said, whispering again. "But they talked a lot, and I listened."<br />
"Who's they?"<br />
"The people in the white clothes."<br />
White clothes? Scientists maybe? Wearing white lab coats?<br />
"And... how did they treat you?"<br />
"I don't understand." She whispered.<br />
"Were they nice to you?"<br />
"What does 'nice' mean?"
