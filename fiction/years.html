      <h1 id="header">For Hundreds and Hundreds of Years</h1>
      <div id="body">
        <p>John Smith was immortal. He was over five thousand years old (or thereabouts) but looked like he was still in his teens. Maybe sixteen or seventeen.<br />
        John Smith was not his real name. He'd had many, many names throughout the millennia. John Smith was a common enough name in this time that nobody would remember him.<br />
        John had also had many jobs. He'd been a soldier in an Egyptian army, a stable boy sometime in the fifteenth century. He'd been a slave and owned slaves, been rich and poor.<br />
        John was also invulnerable. He could not be hurt. Blades and bullets bounced off his skin, he could go forever without food or drink, and the only pain he had ever felt was emotional.</p>

        <p>It was a kind of nice day. The sky was overcast, but the air was humid enough that it was pleasantly warm.<br />
        John was sitting on a bench in a park. He was currently homeless, experimenting with a minimalist lifestyle.<br />
        A girl, a few years younger than John looked, walked across the park to him, and sat down on the bench next to him.<br />
        “Morning,” said John happily.<br />
        “Good morning,” replied the girl somewhat distractedly.<br />
        They sat in silence for a few minutes.<br />
        “I have a question for you.” said the girl at last.<br />
        “Shoot.” said John, watching a squirrel burying a nut near the bench on the other side of the park.<br />
        The girl opened her mouth to ask the question, paused, closed her mouth, thought for a moment, and then said “Do you remember the last time I came to see you?”<br />
        After seeing so many millions of faces, John often had trouble recalling people.<br />
        “I remember I've been visited before.” He said carefully. “But I can't be sure it was you.”<br />
        “OK, enough bullshit. You've been living in this park for as long as I can remember, but you've never aged. You should look a little different after 10 years.”<br />
        “How old are you?” asked John.<br />
        “Fifteen.” She said.<br />
        “Did you notice that your parents aged?” he asked gently.<br />
        She thought for a moment.<br />
        “A little. But you look exactly the same. You’re, what, maybe seventeen? You looked seventeen when I was five, and you look seventeen now. How come?”<br />
        John sighed. The last time this happened, sometime in the seventeenth century, they'd tried to burn him at the stake. He'd escaped once the ropes burned away.<br />
        “No one has a perfect memory,” he said slowly. “Perhaps you just don't remember what I looked like very well, so your brain filled in the gaps, putting the way I look now into the memories.”<br />
        John considered himself something of an expert on the human memory, for obvious reasons.<br />
        She took out her phone, unlocked it, and showed John a picture of him asleep against the fence.<br />
        “That was taken five years ago. I was doing a photography project, and I was looking through my photos when I saw it, remembered seeing you last week and realised you haven't aged a day.”<br />
        John nodded. “So what are you saying? I'm good looking?”<br />
        “I'm saying I think you're immortal.”<br />
        Well, that was quick. People had often been suspicious of John and his eternal youthfulness, but nobody had ever worked out quite why.<br />
        Being invulnerable, John was a risk taker. There were no consequences in his world. And that's why he stopped lying.<br />
        “You’re right,” he said and stood up, spreading his arms wide. “I'm immortal!”</p>

        <p>“Seriously?” said the girl.<br />
        “Yep,” said John with a small grin, letting his arms drop to his side.<br />
        “So how old are you?”<br />
        “Over five thousand.”<br />
        “I don't believe you.” said the girl.<br />
        “First you accuse me, and when I confess, you don't believe me? That's like saying you don't believe yourself.” said John<br />
        “I thought if I came up with something ridiculous, you'd be surprised into explaining.”<br />
        “Ah, OK. Well, I can prove it.”<br />
        “How?”<br />
        John looked around for anyone watching, and seeing nobody, began climbing the tree next to the bench. It was a pine, about twenty metres tall, with branches all over its trunk.<br />
        Once he was near the top, he once again checked for witnesses, and then jumped, and began falling head first toward the ground.<br />
        The girl screamed.<br />
        He hit the ground head first with a terrific thump. His body crumpled, but there were no cracking sounds of breaking bones. He ended up in an ungainly heap.<br />
        The girl stopped screaming and went quiet.<br />
        John untangled himself and got to his feet.<br />
        He decided that when he moved on he could make money out of doing stunts like that.<br />
        “Believe me now?” He asked.<br />
        The girl nodded silently.</p>

        <p>A few minutes later, they were sitting on the bench again.<br />
        “But how?” asked the girl. “How are you immortal? How does it work?”<br />
        “I haven't a clue.” said John. “Thousands of years ago, and for a very long time, I thought I might be half god or something. I still haven't ruled that one out.”<br />
        “So are you religious?”<br />
        “I don't know any more. It's hard to believe in anything for that long.”<br />
        “How old are you exactly?”<br />
        “I'm not sure. We didn't have birth records back then. You just measured years by the seasons.<br />
        I was born in winter, so every winter, I knew I was another year older. I've lost count. I say five thousand because I was born in Egyptian times, and the Egyptians were around five thousand years ago.”<br />
        “So you're Egyptian?” she asked.<br />
        “No. I moved there when I was about eighty.” he replied.<br />
        “Who was Pharaoh at the time?” she asked.<br />
        “I can't remember. I'm not good with names.” he replied.<br />
        “Well, what was he like?” she asked.<br />
        “I don't know. I never met him. Why do you ask?” he asked.<br />
        “Well, if you knew who was Pharaoh, you could work out how old you are.” she replied.<br />
        He chuckled. “When you’re my age, time becomes kind of meaningless. I've been living in this park for... I don't even know, maybe twenty years. It feels like five minutes.”<br />
        “When did you realise you were immortal?<br />
        “When I was twenty. I think.”<br />
        “How long do you think you'll live?”<br />
        “Forever.”<br />
        “That's impossible. You've got to die at some point. What if there's a nuclear war?”<br />
        “I've been shot point blank with bows and arrows, cannons, guns, jumped into a volcano, been buried alive for three years, spent a century without food or water, been run over, burned at the stake, and jumped off more cliffs than years you've lived. I can't die.”<br />
        The girl was silent after that.<br />
        “What's your name?” asked John.<br />
        “Katy,” She said. “What's yours?”<br />
        “John.”<br />
        They sat in silence for a few minutes. Katy looked at her watch. John listened to the bird song.<br />
        “I have to go.” said Katy. “I assume you'll be here when I come back?”<br />
        “Of course” said John.<br />
        Katy walked away.<br />
        “I'll still be here long after you've gone.” He said sadly as he watched Katy leave.</p>

        <p>Katy returned the next morning. The air was a little crisper than the previous day, but the sky was still overcast.<br />
        John was sitting on the ground, leaning against the tree he had jumped out of yesterday. He had climbed it and jumped out of it again when he woke up earlier that morning. He had needed the adrenaline rush to make sure he was awake when Katy came back.<br />
        Despite being invulnerable, he still got adrenaline rushes. His body didn't care that he couldn't be hurt, it wanted him ready for danger all the same.<br />
        She sat on the end of the bench sideways, facing him.<br />
        “Morning.” said John.<br />
        “Good morning.” Katy replied.<br />
        “Any more questions?” asked John.<br />
        “I was wondering if you would give me a history lesson. Tell me everything you remember.”<br />
        “My life story?” asked John.<br />
        “Basically, yeah.”<br />
        “Give me a minute. I need to try and get the memories straight in my head.” He said.<br />
        Eventually, he began talking.<br />
        “I was born in...”<br />
        John told her everything he could remember, from his childhood to his teens, his discovery of his immortality, joining the Egyptian army, leaving when they grew suspicious of the way he was never injured, travelling the world, all the wars he fought in, the famous people he had seen, all his suicide attempts, being a slave, becoming a stable boy for one king, and knight for the next, all the times people tried to kill him for witchcraft, the civilisations he had seen rise and fall.<br />
        It took all day.</p>

        <p>Katy often came to visit, but he had to move to the bridge over the river before anyone else became suspicious. She still visited, but not as often, as she grew up and got a job.<br />
        When she had children, she stopped seeing him altogether, so he left and decided to travel the world.<br />
        For hundreds and hundreds of years he travelled the world, visiting every country and land. He tried to learn everything, to read every book. He learned to meditate. He was framed and sentenced to life in prison, and he sat in his cell until the prison crumbled around him. Then he kept exploring until he knew the whole earth.<br />
        Humankind eventually ceased to exist, and the earth changed, so John explored it all again.<br />
        Learning and forgetting all the time.<br />
        For millions of years John wandered, until life no longer existed and the earth changed all the while, and John kept travelling.<br />
        Eventually, the sun exploded and destroyed the solar system, and John was flung out into space. He floated through space for billions of years, seeing entire galaxies be born and die. John kept floating, until all he knew was the positions of the stars, and he saw them whether his eyes were open or not. An uncountable amount of time later, there was not enough energy left in the universe and no new stars were formed.</p>

        <p>They winked and faded out one by one.</p>

        <p>After trillion and trillions of years, all that was left was blackness, an infinite darkness for an unknowable distance in every direction.<br />
        John kept floating in the empty nothingness, and his heart kept pumping his blood around his body, although there had been no oxygen in it for most of his life.</p>

        <p>John kept floating.</p>

        <p>John kept floating.</p>

        <p>John kept floating until the very dimensions in which he existed ceased to exist and his consciousness was eroded away.</p>

        <p>But John was still floating.</p>
