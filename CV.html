    <h3>Personal Profile</h3>
      <p>I have just finished studying Computer Science A-level and two BTEC’s in ICT at the University Technical College Reading. I am looking to build a career in IT support where I can demonstrate a variety of technical skills and expertise - in particular, hardware diagnosis and repair - and further develop those skills. I enjoy solving problems with the use of technology, and assisting others in doing so, and therefore I feel I would be well suited to a role in 1st line support.</p>
